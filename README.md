## Prudentia — Explainable Credit Risk Decisioning Engine
An end-to-end credit risk system that goes beyond default prediction to deliver calibrated, cost-optimized, explainable, and fairness-audited lending decisions — combining traditional scorecard modeling, modern gradient-boosted machine learning, and production-style model risk monitoring.

Python scikit-learn XGBoost SHAP MLflow FastAPI Streamlit

## Overview

Prudentia is an end-to-end credit risk decisioning platform that predicts borrower default risk and converts that prediction into an actual, defensible lending decision — not just a probability score sitting in a notebook.

Most public credit risk projects stop at "train a model, report AUC." Prudentia instead treats risk modeling as what it actually is inside a regulated lender: a **decisioning lifecycle** — predict, calibrate, price, explain, audit for fairness, and monitor for drift after deployment. This is deliberately closer to how a bank's model risk management (MRM) function evaluates a model before it's approved for production than it is to a typical Kaggle submission.

The system is built on ~2.2M real Lending Club loans (2007–2018), using the loan's actual issue date to run genuine time-aware validation — training on earlier vintages and testing out-of-time on later ones, the way credit models are actually validated in practice, rather than a random shuffle that leaks future information into training.

**Positioning note:** Credit scoring itself is a mature, well-understood problem. Prudentia does not claim to invent a new prediction technique — its value is in demonstrating the *responsible deployment lifecycle* around a mature technique: calibration, cost-based decisioning, explainability, fairness auditing, and drift monitoring. This is the discipline that separates a model that gets approved for production at a bank from one that stays a notebook.

## Key Features

### Data Engineering
- Leakage audit distinguishing application-time features from post-origination outcome fields
- Time-aware (out-of-time) train/validation/test split based on loan issue date
- WOE (Weight of Evidence) binning with Information Value (IV) feature ranking

### Modeling
- WOE + Logistic Regression scorecard — the interpretable, regulator-approved baseline
- Random Forest — an interpretable non-linear challenger
- XGBoost — the top-performing gradient-boosted challenger
- Hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV
- Model comparison on KS-statistic, Gini coefficient, AUC-ROC, and PR-AUC — the metrics credit risk teams actually report

### Decisioning Layer
- Probability calibration (isotonic regression / Platt scaling) with reliability diagrams and Brier score
- Cost-sensitive threshold optimization based on explicit, documented dollar costs of false negatives vs. false positives
- Risk-based pricing tiers benchmarked against Lending Club's own assigned loan grades and interest rates

### Explainability & Fairness
- SHAP global and local (per-loan) explanations
- Automated adverse-action reason code generation (mirroring ECOA / Regulation B requirements for credit denial explanations)
- Disparate impact (80% rule) fairness audit across age, income, and geographic segments

### Monitoring
- Population Stability Index (PSI) tracking for features and model score across loan vintages
- Simulated drift alerting to flag when a retraining review would be warranted

### Application Layer
- FastAPI `/score` endpoint returning predicted default probability, calibrated probability, risk tier, decision, and top reason codes
- Streamlit decision dashboard for a loan-officer-style view of individual applicant decisions

### Evaluation & Observability
- MLflow experiment tracking across all model runs and hyperparameter configurations

## Example Use Cases

**Risk Scoring**
- What is this applicant's calibrated probability of default?
- Which risk tier and interest rate should this applicant be offered?

**Decision Explainability**
- Why was this applicant denied? (adverse action reason codes)
- Which features most influenced this specific score? (local SHAP explanation)

**Portfolio-Level Analysis**
- How does model-driven risk-based pricing compare to Lending Club's actual assigned grades?
- Are outcomes systematically worse for any age, income, or geographic segment?
- Has the borrower population drifted enough since training to warrant model review?

## Engineering Highlights

One of the primary goals of Prudentia was to build a system that demonstrates production-inspired, model-risk-aware credit modeling practices rather than an isolated prediction notebook.

Some notable design decisions include:

- Time-aware, out-of-time validation instead of a random train/test split, to avoid leaking future information across economic cycles
- Explicit leakage audit distinguishing application-time features from post-origination outcome fields
- Benchmarking a fully interpretable scorecard against modern ML challengers rather than discarding the traditional approach
- Cost-based decision thresholding instead of a default 0.5 cutoff, grounded in documented dollar cost assumptions
- Explainability designed around a real regulatory requirement (ECOA/Reg B adverse action notices), not generic "nice to have" interpretability
- A dedicated fairness audit examining disparate impact across borrower segments
- Post-deployment thinking built in from the start via PSI-based drift monitoring, rather than treating deployment as the finish line

## Future Enhancements

Planned future improvements include:

- Authentication and role-based access for the dashboard
- Automated retraining triggers based on PSI drift thresholds
- Expanded fairness audit with intersectional segment analysis
- Cloud deployment
- CI/CD pipeline with automated model validation checks

## Disclaimer

Prudentia uses historical, publicly available Lending Club loan data and is intended for educational, research, and engineering demonstration purposes only.

This project is not a production credit decisioning system and should not be used for actual lending decisions.
